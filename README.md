![GitHub Downloads](https://badgen.net/github/assets-dl/jneilliii/OctoPrint-Python3PluginCompatibilityCheck/)

This plugin simply adds a section in settings that allows you to check your installed plugins against the OctoPrint Plugin Repository list to see which ones are not yet Python 3 compatible.

## Checking Compatibility

After installing, open OctoPrint's settings and click `Python 3 Check` in the plugins section. Press the `Check Compatibility` button and a list of links to the plugin's homepages will be generated. Click the link and open a new issue in the plugin's repository requesting for Python 3 compatibility.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:
